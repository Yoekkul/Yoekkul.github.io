### Roads
Fine strands of road grow like creeping moss where nothing but emptynes resides. \\
They are not yet veins of civilization, they  hint at its presence. They transform. \\
"Humans pass here", one day they wisper, "here is safety" they say, "follow our command!" they scream; and just like memory, when not well trod they shift and disappear.


### From the air
Spiderwebs of morning dew \\
Cities with their nightly life \\
Glide under the view \\
And as ores glitter \\
In the darkness of the night

### The last alchemist
I have been invited to the alchemist for tea. \\
An instant after my knock the door gets ripped open and I pulled in, past tables overflowing with tomes, bubbling beakers and foul smelling powders.
"This is the container!" The alchemist exclaims. I have barely managed to find a seat on the only empty, slighlty corroded stool in the room. "The container?" I ask, eyeing the oil lamp. \\
"Yes! I bought it before the work is finished! Of course it won't hold for long, god will find a way to break out".
I eye the bottle, inspecting the shaky runic seals engraved in it. "It is such a tragedy" the alchemist sighs "that the god I must create will be only filled by rage and indifference to us ants".\\
The last alchemist is raving, foam forming around the mouth. "Fitting that the best will also be the last"
My hasty disappearance through the door is not even noticed. Their full attention has returned to the work, sifting and mixing sand.

### Eden's entropy
Earth is destroyed by the fires of the past. Satellites peer over the lands for mankind, ready to return it into dust. The few left are nomads. Never stopping they escape the untiring ire of the god's eyes.\\
Blind nature returns to the glassed ruins,  among which one ethereal figure walks forward... Looking for treasures of eons past. 

Suddenly. 

Their eye spots order in nature's organized chaos. It is a garden, tended by untiring, masterless servants. Hedges are trimmed weeds are pruned, paths are kept. \\
What grows in this garden can only satiate the eye.\\
The lone figure moves on
